# 🚀 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice programs implemented in **C++** and **Python**.  
It serves as my learning archive and demonstrates solutions to common coding interview problems.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **cpp/** → C++ implementations of DSA problems  
- **python/** → Python implementations of DSA problems  

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Arrays  
- Linked Lists (Singly & Circular)  
- Sorting Algorithms  
- Searching  
- 2D Matrices  
- More topics will be added: Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.  

---

## 🛠️ Languages Used
- **C++** (STL + raw implementations)  
- **Python** (clean, beginner-friendly code)  

---

## 🎯 Key Focus
- Writing **clean and modular code**  
- Practicing **problem-solving with DSA**  
- Documenting **time & space complexity**  
- Maintaining both **C++ and Python solutions**  

---

## 🔗 Future Updates
I will keep adding more problems regularly under respective folders (e.g., Trees, Graphs, DP).  

Stay tuned 🚀
